# What is Machine Leaning?

Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that is concerned with building algorithms which, to be useful, rely on a collection of examples of some phenomenon. These examples can come from nature, be handcrafted by humans or generated by another algorithm.

Basically, machine learning **explores algorithms to build models** for data, and eventually these models are used for **prediction, decision making** or **solving tasks.** Ex: Filtering spam emails

## Types of Learning 

- Supervised: The dataset is the collection of labeled examples. It has 2 ctaegories of algorithms:
  - Classification
  - Regression
- Semi-supervised: The dataset contains both labeled and unlabeled examples. 
- Unsupervised: The dataset is a collection of unlabeled examples. It is further classified as:
  - Clustering 
  - Association
- Reinforcement: Feedback-based learning method 

# Why Machine Learning?

- Recent progress in algorithms and theory 
- Growing surge of online data
- Computational power is available 

# When to use Machine Learning? 

- Tasks that are too complex to program 
  - tasks beyond human capabilities i.e. analysis of very large/complex data
  
- Adaptivity
  - ML programs whose behaviour adapts to the input data are useful. Ex: Speech recognition
