## Purpose of this repository 

This repos is a documentation of my journey of learning about Machine Learning. Currently, my learnings are based on the course offered by my Uni, [IT340 Machine Learning](https://www.notion.so/ankitapriya/Course-Syllabus-208a3ef25acc486184ad6deff5a84e5d), a variety of YouTube videos, other online courses, blog posts and research papers. I will update all the links I refer, shortly. 

## Coding Language, IDE and Libraries used 

All coding woeks are done in Python 3.8 and the IDE used to create them was using Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook, you can download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). 

The Machine Learning models are coded using the following libraries:
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib 
- Pandas
- Seaborn
